# apps_todo
Application designed to manage to-do tasks

# Running the app
The only thing required to run the `TodoApp` is `docker`. After this perform the following actions:
- execute `docker-compose up` from the root folder
  - it may take some time to build the images the first time as the images will be downloaded and built
  - it may take some time to warm up the `database` for the first time as the `pgdata` volume will be created. 
  - it might prompt you for permissions to watch the code folders
  - when the `backend` app comes up it will apply the database migrations to initialize the db schema
  - when the `frontend` app comes up it will build the Angular app.
- access the backend api on `http://localhost:5555/swagger/index.html`
- access the frontend url on `http://localhost:4201`
